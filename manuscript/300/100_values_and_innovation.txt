* [ ] @todo - p1 - In #progress #buildtolast #core "Values and progressing" - Edit this chapter to consider the case of Brazilian mayonese, or "Batatonese" and the the Spanish contribution to this domain. As I spent 30 days in Spain, having found many places with that "mayo salad" which they called "Russian salad" or "Ensaladita" I end up redefining my views. In other words, Spain helped me to rethink possibilities for this thing which I thought was pretty much too basic to accept changes. So here is a reflection about when we anchor ourselves around one way of doing, static, it's when we lose the opportunity. 

* [ ] @todo - p1 - In #progress #buildtolast #core "Values and progressing", after we arrive at concept from Build to Last, consider the insight from Dorothea Brande's about how it feels, an apparent trick? Where the progress with "purposeful action" feels fast, and her point that purposeful action is stronger. (Ref 160_progressing_with_no_core)

* [ ] @todo - p1 - In #progress #buildtolast #core - Bring the case of Jim Collins into the subject, the case of entrepreneurs. Ref /  as we consider this idea we should incorporate here the ideas from Jim Collins and Jerry Porras, through the book Build to Last, where they present the concept of "preserve the core, and stimulate progress". (Ref 160_progressing_with_no_core)
