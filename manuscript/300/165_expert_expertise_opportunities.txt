I'm just gonna outsource that—my lawyer will solve that, or my friend will solve that. The great entrepreneurs establish what I call this minimal level of competency in every discipline, and I don't really see exceptions to that."

There are circumstances where we may think that digging into a problem may actually take us into complications, and with that, we just generally overlook or we assume that digging is not good because there are things that can be solved in the particular environment that we are, generally gives us alternate options for not engaging with that digging. One general reason for doing so is that it's coherent to advance, why to bother with specific processes, plus we can always kind of dig into the rabbit hole role. So we fear to be involved with the process and that kind of thing, as an example. With that being said, we are here to reflect about the circumstances where it matters to actually look at the matter, to do some digging. It may actually allow us to see certain problems from a new angle, and that can take us to see opportunities that actually gives us the possibility of moving faster.

So, let us go through an example of a domain, particular domain, which may generally assume the challenges involved there aren't worth the benefits. This is the word of the bread, such as the slow fermentation bread, which is generally in Spanish known as the Pão de Massa Madre, in Portuguese, Pão de Deus. But that's a slow fermentation bread. And what we know from that is that it's slow. I guess the title gives us that hint there, right? And if you dig, you're going to actually get information from your initial research that it is a complex process. So there's a vocabulary here, there, right? There's a language here telling us that this is certainly valuable, right? It wouldn't be called Pão de Deus in Portuguese or Pão de Massa Madre, right? And the idea of the slow baking, slow cooking and slow fermentation, we all know by now that you will certainly find a valuable product, right? With that, I think there is a narrative too that, you know, in many of these cases, these are like two special products or solutions or experiences, right? Like a great wine, an aged whiskey, and these various kinds of special bread, right, throughout Europe for certain. And that's it.

So now, the complication here for us and we generally get an answer right away. But the complication here for us is that this narrative, even though as simple as I put it, starting with the title and some hints there and the things we know, when we compare with other narratives for solutions that gives us bread, say, because we're in front of the job to be done and the job is to serve bread in a way or another to your customer. These narratives of alternative solutions compared with that initial narrative that we know will take us to just accept the alternate solution if you actually are in front of such, right? So let's go through a case of what could be an alternative solution that you have in front of you. It may be so that a supplier or when you do yourself the online query looking for vendors and suppliers gives you then a solution for that so needed bread that will give you the answer to the job that you want to do and this bread performs better. It actually has a taste that it's popular and people will recognize, it's not like an extreme taste, it's not sour, it's not too salty, right? It's kind of like the sweet spot for the taste and it's cost effective, of course, right? And you can bake it in using a simple process. There is always like a number of recommended ovens that you can use, right? It's not complicated at all and so you have right there standardization, certain perspective, sweet spot for taste and acceptance with the customer. It's a practical solution for you and that's it. So when you compare those basic narratives this second case wings, you make a decision, you have your bread, you have your part of the job done and as the vendor promises that that's a big deal towards your success. That's your ultimate job because you want to be successful anyway. With that you can position your product with good value for the customer and so on.

Now a complication that we have here is that this vendor has the product, this product was designed and they're not only the architects of the design that came up with the solution involved there, there are also architects that have designed their narrative as well, showing you the values. And now the problem here is that you might be comparing this quite evolved, advanced narrative, coherent narrative and solution altogether bundle with an idea that doesn't have this communication in place and we usually guess that's the case because probably alternate solutions wouldn't work anyway, so looking from above it's all coherent anyway. But let's as an exercise, for a moment here, let's do an exercise of potential narratives and this exercise, the reason that I'm giving you this exercise is that I was certain that certain kinds of bread that more like the slow fermentation bread and kind of like the pan de masa madre wouldn't work at all in my previous thinking, but after I did a course with the chef and an instructor that happened, I lived through an event there and that gave me the motivation for this exercise. So first I'm going to tell you about the event that changed my mind. The course were this full day course on making bread, right, the slow fermentation process, that kind of thing, and hands-on for the whole day and the program started with the breakfast, the actual bread and the end goal for us would be to take home our delicious bread that we made. And to tease you about this course, I'm gonna talk about the end goal first and I took home I think six different breads, one with fig and Damascus, and another with Parmesan cheese, and four others different wheat mixtures, all based in the east, that is what we call the wild east, which is the starter that you keep on using, so we learn about, this course would involve learning about that thing as well, the process, but basically these amazing breads I took home warm, but in the very beginning we started with a breakfast and that breakfast experience right away were amazing, simple coffee there with milk and bread, not many kinds, one kind of bread, bake it fresh, delicious, and I didn't actually formulate the question that eventually came up and I asked the professor in the beginning, I don't know why, I think my unconscious did formulate, because I was like, hey, okay, so when were this bread made so fresh and bake it, because this I know it's a fermentation process, a slow fermentation process, and so this is in the morning, so this thing were like fermenting and growing and before that, for how many days and what's the prior process before that, right, and then as the course went on and we're talking about the bread, the fermentation process, etc., then at a certain point, I think the professor mentioned freezing the bread, and then I asked, hey, by the way, that bread that I made in the morning was frozen, and the professor said yes, and then I said, oh, so that's not as good as another freshly made, right, and then I had the question, what's the difference between a fresh one and the frozen one, and how long can you freeze, and he said that for up to six months you can freeze, and he, as a professional, can't tell the difference. When I heard that, my mind changed entirely. I know, then I realized, right, that was just an assumption, I don't know this industry, I don't know how the freezing process works, but the point here that he was telling us is that you pre-bake it, then you freeze, and then when you warm up the bread, you post-bake it, and then it becomes beautiful and fresh, and no one can tell the difference. At that moment, something changed entirely for me, and I saw that this kind of bread, for example, could be used, could be present better in the process within many food establishments that wanted to have a different kind of solution there.

So now the exercise, because of that new insight, new perspective, looking things from an optimistic reality, then I invite you to the exercise now to follow along with what could be if we're designing the arguments for a solution here. So in terms of these arguments, what we have is, you can pre-bake and freeze, and then you have a stock with the volume of the bread that every day you can post-bake it. Giving to your customers the experiences of a fresh, special bread, but in fact, a special bread that were done with a slow fermentation process, so special, so fresh every day. Another point, this is healthier, there's an argument that because of the stages and the slow fermentation, and the process usually involved with this kind of bread, it produces the wheat chemical structures where you find that it's healthier in terms of sugar regulation, that kind of thing. Well, the flavor is much better, the flavor is unique, it looks great, and there is a texture. So all of that gives you a value for higher returns and uniqueness in your place. So here we have the performance argument, because you're giving to your customers a special bread usually associated with a complex process, but now within the higher performance perspective. So this could be arguments for this solution, right? And now, if you had two different vendors, let's say that a vendor gave you the frozen, slow fermentation, pre-baked bread, and a suggestion for the oven, if you didn't have one, and now you have that different vendor, maybe your place could actually pick this solution. So going back to the point about the digging. Digging starts with recognition that the narrative with the given solution in front of you uses the comparative narrative so that you have an impression that a certain solution wins. But it only happens when the other group with the other solution don't have a solution design and a narrative design right there. That's the first consideration about the communication that is in front of you, and especially as you know, you're under pressure to pick up, to decide quick and put into operation. So that's the first thing right there. And of course, the second point is that the digging, the involvement, that was one day course indeed, that's an investment. You have to pause everything or maybe you would need to do some research. And of course, in some case, you depend on the actual process of the vendor in your market area. But still, nevertheless, we were only able to artificially create the narrative and the solution in a way to a certain extent, because after the fact that I had a kind of awakening, a discovery that changed my mind to have an optimistic perspective there and to get involved and to think about the possibility of a process. The case for many others who are involved with bread can be just so basic here, because maybe bread makers know that. But again, we're not talking about professional bread makers. We're talking about leaders who are, in fact, involved with operation, need to decide faster. So that here, again, a reminder about slow down, look at things, consider not to be an expert. An expert in a specific field through that involvement, but consider to be involved to a certain extent, to give yourself a chance to see certain processes. Especially if you have a kind of a connection with that given direction. Because who knows what if your idea, the thing that you're designing would be amazing if you had that kind of bread, for example.

So, if you, especially in those circumstances, if you don't give yourself a chance to see and consider the digging and then to look at the process of expertise and to feel optimistic, which could actually push you to find solutions, you lose right there. But it will also lose because within the context that you like that direction, if you don't do that, you're going to have the second option. And the second option is to move along, to advance, to follow up, to be a follower, to accept the reality that you're not happy now, but you're going to have to live with that anyway. And that's the reality because you depend on these vendors. But then the problem here is that you are sad. It's not the kind of place that you really want. It's not the kind of bread that you really want with your experience. And that's where things start to take a new course because somewhere you were to be happier with that other bread experience. Now, you're not dreaming anymore. You're not developing yourself and advancing into that world of possibilities. And by the way, advancing because your establishment is alive. And if you're motivated, if you're happy, if you like that kind of solution, you have years to continue to look at the process. But if you dislike the other option, you're stuck with it, you will not have years of being positioned as a person that is not interested at all in involving any process. You're basically now accepting what one appears in front of you and says, and that's the risk that you can set yourself in. And that's going to spread through your company, through your colleagues. That's going to impact the future of your establishment and that's going to impact the whole relationship with the customers, etc.
