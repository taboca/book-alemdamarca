Existem situações onde se aprofundar no problema nos leva a grandes complicações. Com isso, nós geralmente assumimos que aprofundar não é uma opção válida. Ainda mais, além disso, que existem formas de resolver o problema sem se aprofundar tanto. Essa situação torna a ficar cada vez mais familiar.

Uma motivação para fazer dessa forma é porque é coerente avançar. Por que se preocupar com processos específicos? Além disso, existe a possibilidade de entrarmos na toca do coelho. Com isso, temos medo de nos envolver em processos.

Com isso dito, vamos refletir sobre as circunstâncias onde, de fato, adentrar o assunto pode ser interessante. Em outras palavras, cavar um pouco. Isto porque pode nos ajudar a ver problemas por um ângulo novo e, assim, encontrar oportunidades. Inclusive, avançar mais rápido.

Para o domínio, em particular, onde assumimos que os desafios não valem a pena. Dentro do mundo de pão, é o pão de fermentação lenta ou pão de Deus.

Os problemas começam logo de cara. Pão de Deus, talvez seja uma coisa tão distante das coisas da terra. Ou pão de fermentação lenta. Nós não vivemos em um mundo lento. Então o que sabemos sobre isso é que é bem lento. Essa questão do título nos dá uma dica, certo? E se você se interessar, você de fato receberá mais informações a partir da pesquisa e confirmará que é um processo complicado.

Então, tem todo um dicionário ou uma linguagem no meio disso. Nós sabemos bem que existem grandes valores lá, não seria chamado Pão de Deus ou Pá de Massa Madre em espanhol se não fosse algo especial, se não fosse diferente das coisas da terra. E sobre essas coisas do cozimento lento ou da fermentação lenta também sabemos que tem algo de valor lá, não é mesmo?

Então, temos aqui definitivamente uma narrativa sobre produtos, soluções e experiências que nos impressiona, como um vinho de uma safra especial, um whisky envelhecido no carvalho, uma pinga também envelhecida no bálsamo, pão de fermentação natural com fermento especial passado por gerações, um saquê especial, uma carne curada por anos, um queijo curado por anos, um ecossistema de bactérias e fungos especiais às margens do rio Sena que permite a criação de uma cerveja selvagem na Bélgica.

Então, agora, a complicação é que temos uma resposta rápida, praticamente instintiva e medular. A complicação é que essa narrativa, que aparenta ser simples, traz nessa simplicidade dicas e títulos, e essa linguagem, e essas coisas que sabemos, que tornam-se fortes argumentos. Principalmente na hora que comparamos com soluções alternativas. Dessa forma, resolvemos rapidamente, por conta desse cálculo comparativo. Pensando na situação do pão, quando estamos na frente de um trabalho e assumimos que o trabalho é servir o pão, agora temos praticamente um enquadre para essa comparação rápida. Se você tiver uma solução alternativa, um pão rápido, como esse outro pão tão especial, metade do problema está resolvido. É especial demais, transcende demais ao enquadre real. Essas narrativas, soluções alternativas comparadas com a narrativa inicial, irão nos levar a aceitar a solução alternativa, se você estiver na frente dessa balança, dessa vontade de comparar rapidamente.

Vamos acompanhar o que seria o processo de interação quando procuramos uma solução diante de uma necessidade. Pode ser que um fornecedor apareça na sua frente, ou você fez uma busca online procurando por fornecedores, buscando uma solução diante da necessidade de entregar a experiência do pão, por conta daquele trabalho que tem que ser contratado. Você acabou encontrando um pão, que é popular, que as pessoas reconhecem como pão. O gosto não é extremo, não é nem azedo, nem salgado, certo? É uma espécie de zona perfeita em relação ao sabor e também ao custo, e você pode acessar facilmente em vários tipos de fornos.

O que você encontrou não traz complicações. Você tem logo lá uma padronização, uma perspectiva, uma zona ideal na questão da experiência, do sabor, ligada à aceitação do cliente. É uma solução prática e é isso mesmo. Então quando você compara essa narrativa com aquelas narrativas, essa narrativa ganha. Você faz a decisão, você tem o seu pão, você tem parte daquele trabalho feito. Além do suporte daquele fornecedor ou desses fornecedores que estão dizendo claramente que estão preocupados com o seu sucesso. E não é que é isso mesmo, este é o último trabalho a ser contratado depois de qualquer trabalho intermediário. Você está em busca de sucesso.

Agora, a complicação que temos aqui é que este fornecedor tem uma solução completa. Este produto foi feito utilizando de um designer profissional. E não existem só arquitetos que criaram a solução, por conta que existem outros profissionais que trabalharam na narrativa também. A experiência  apresentada carrega  coerência e argumentos sólidos com valores que nos ajudam a decidir. Então, agora, estamos comparando uma proposta extremamente desenvolvida de uma solução prática por uma narrativa avançada - tudo bem empacotado. Isso contra uma outra ideia que não tem esse tipo de comunicação que favorece a decisão. Nessa hora, aquela outra não carrega todo esse aparelhamento. Também perde porque  acabamos adivinhando muita coisa sobre aquele passado, com fragmentos de informação. Ou pensamos naquela visão grandiosa - especial - e logo pensamos que é demais para nossa realidade aqui na terra. 

Então olhando por cima, colocando na balança - que é o que mais sabemos fazer - esse processo fica simples de ser resolvido.

But let's as an exercise, for a moment here, let's do an exercise of potential narratives and this exercise, the reason that I'm giving you this exercise is that I was certain that certain kinds of bread that more like the slow fermentation bread and kind of like the pan de masa madre wouldn't work at all in my previous thinking, but after I did a course with the chef and an instructor that happened, I lived through an event there and that gave me the motivation for this exercise. So first I'm going to tell you about the event that changed my mind. The course were this full day course on making bread, right, the slow fermentation process, that kind of thing, and hands-on for the whole day and the program started with the breakfast, the actual bread and the end goal for us would be to take home our delicious bread that we made. And to tease you about this course, I'm gonna talk about the end goal first and I took home I think six different breads, one with fig and Damascus, and another with Parmesan cheese, and four others different wheat mixtures, all based in the east, that is what we call the wild east, which is the starter that you keep on using, so we learn about, this course would involve learning about that thing as well, the process, but basically these amazing breads I took home warm, but in the very beginning we started with a breakfast and that breakfast experience right away were amazing, simple coffee there with milk and bread, not many kinds, one kind of bread, bake it fresh, delicious, and I didn't actually formulate the question that eventually came up and I asked the professor in the beginning, I don't know why, I think my unconscious did formulate, because I was like, hey, okay, so when were this bread made so fresh and bake it, because this I know it's a fermentation process, a slow fermentation process, and so this is in the morning, so this thing were like fermenting and growing and before that, for how many days and what's the prior process before that, right, and then as the course went on and we're talking about the bread, the fermentation process, etc., then at a certain point, I think the professor mentioned freezing the bread, and then I asked, hey, by the way, that bread that I made in the morning was frozen, and the professor said yes, and then I said, oh, so that's not as good as another freshly made, right, and then I had the question, what's the difference between a fresh one and the frozen one, and how long can you freeze, and he said that for up to six months you can freeze, and he, as a professional, can't tell the difference. When I heard that, my mind changed entirely. I know, then I realized, right, that was just an assumption, I don't know this industry, I don't know how the freezing process works, but the point here that he was telling us is that you pre-bake it, then you freeze, and then when you warm up the bread, you post-bake it, and then it becomes beautiful and fresh, and no one can tell the difference. At that moment, something changed entirely for me, and I saw that this kind of bread, for example, could be used, could be present better in the process within many food establishments that wanted to have a different kind of solution there.

So now the exercise, because of that new insight, new perspective, looking things from an optimistic reality, then I invite you to the exercise now to follow along with what could be if we're designing the arguments for a solution here. So in terms of these arguments, what we have is, you can pre-bake and freeze, and then you have a stock with the volume of the bread that every day you can post-bake it. Giving to your customers the experiences of a fresh, special bread, but in fact, a special bread that were done with a slow fermentation process, so special, so fresh every day. Another point, this is healthier, there's an argument that because of the stages and the slow fermentation, and the process usually involved with this kind of bread, it produces the wheat chemical structures where you find that it's healthier in terms of sugar regulation, that kind of thing. Well, the flavor is much better, the flavor is unique, it looks great, and there is a texture. So all of that gives you a value for higher returns and uniqueness in your place. So here we have the performance argument, because you're giving to your customers a special bread usually associated with a complex process, but now within the higher performance perspective. So this could be arguments for this solution, right? And now, if you had two different vendors, let's say that a vendor gave you the frozen, slow fermentation, pre-baked bread, and a suggestion for the oven, if you didn't have one, and now you have that different vendor, maybe your place could actually pick this solution. So going back to the point about the digging. Digging starts with recognition that the narrative with the given solution in front of you uses the comparative narrative so that you have an impression that a certain solution wins. But it only happens when the other group with the other solution don't have a solution design and a narrative design right there. That's the first consideration about the communication that is in front of you, and especially as you know, you're under pressure to pick up, to decide quick and put into operation. So that's the first thing right there. And of course, the second point is that the digging, the involvement, that was one day course indeed, that's an investment. You have to pause everything or maybe you would need to do some research. And of course, in some case, you depend on the actual process of the vendor in your market area. But still, nevertheless, we were only able to artificially create the narrative and the solution in a way to a certain extent, because after the fact that I had a kind of awakening, a discovery that changed my mind to have an optimistic perspective there and to get involved and to think about the possibility of a process. The case for many others who are involved with bread can be just so basic here, because maybe bread makers know that. But again, we're not talking about professional bread makers. We're talking about leaders who are, in fact, involved with operation, need to decide faster. So that here, again, a reminder about slow down, look at things, consider not to be an expert. An expert in a specific field through that involvement, but consider to be involved to a certain extent, to give yourself a chance to see certain processes. Especially if you have a kind of a connection with that given direction. Because who knows what if your idea, the thing that you're designing would be amazing if you had that kind of bread, for example.

So, if you, especially in those circumstances, if you don't give yourself a chance to see and consider the digging and then to look at the process of expertise and to feel optimistic, which could actually push you to find solutions, you lose right there. But it will also lose because within the context that you like that direction, if you don't do that, you're going to have the second option. And the second option is to move along, to advance, to follow up, to be a follower, to accept the reality that you're not happy now, but you're going to have to live with that anyway. And that's the reality because you depend on these vendors. But then the problem here is that you are sad. It's not the kind of place that you really want. It's not the kind of bread that you really want with your experience. And that's where things start to take a new course because somewhere you were to be happier with that other bread experience. Now, you're not dreaming anymore. You're not developing yourself and advancing into that world of possibilities. And by the way, advancing because your establishment is alive. And if you're motivated, if you're happy, if you like that kind of solution, you have years to continue to look at the process. But if you dislike the other option, you're stuck with it, you will not have years of being positioned as a person that is not interested at all in involving any process. You're basically now accepting what one appears in front of you and says, and that's the risk that you can set yourself in. And that's going to spread through your company, through your colleagues. That's going to impact the future of your establishment and that's going to impact the whole relationship with the customers, etc.

In the talk entitled, Brian Cheskin on Launching Airbnb and the Challenges of Scale, Brian was asked by a student to talk about the topic, learning how to learn. First, Brian had recognized, since he were given an interview in front of a Stanford freshman students, that at Stanford there are experts in that subject. Here we need a footnote linking to the work of learning how to learn Stanford course. End of footnote. Anyway, he went on, offering a piece of advice applicable to the situation when you are challenged to learn. So he said, open quote, if I tell you, if I told you, I want you to learn about a topic, and you got a week to do it. End quote. Here Brian was setting the challenge of learning fast first, or under pressure. And he and he and he emphasized that he wanted, or what he is talking about is really, to some extent, a serious involvement. As in, open quote, and I want you to really learn it. End quote. As in, to become like an expert. Or, as he said, a temporary expert, so that you could know the basics. To know the most important things.

Then, he contextualizes the normal path, where our thoughts are going to guide us automatically, telling us to go after books, resources, as many as possible, talk with many people, that kind of thing, which would be a quite exhaustive process in order to learn just the basics of that topic. And to add more pressure to this whole situation, he reminds us that entrepreneurs have a long journey, especially in the case of scaling startups. And with that, of course, we have here the obvious challenge that the strategy of digging or going after too many resources just doesn't work. Having him contextualized the complication, he guided the students towards the solution, as in the logical solution, which involves the recognition that, open quote, you have to be very good at short-circuiting, end quote. I agree, that's basically the challenge of learning how to learn under pressure that, to some extent, involves short-circuiting, indeed. But here we are talking about to be cautious about this short-circuiting. And I say this before we go on with the prime thoughts, because the meaning of short-circuiting varies between different people. For example, one person may not accept at all the idea of reading as short-circuiting. Anyway, Brian highlighted the importance of being aware of our movement by learning and being actively looking for the definite source. He points out that the ability to engage and to identify this definite source is a skill. With that, he points the complication, setting a reference point there, that if we go for the wrong source, we are of course going to learn the wrong things. Listening to Brian's thoughts on this, when I revisited the video in slow motion, and knowing that Brian is recognized by one of his first investors, which is next to him interviewing him, Reid Hoffman, being recognized as a model of a person that knows that skill, or in Reid's words, Brian's an infinite learner, made me think or to pause and really feel how we are generally trapped by our own drive or need for results.

But more than that, how our quick movements, thinking that we have learned, may actually set us into living the consequences, either negative or positive consequences. Nevertheless, having to deal with the cost, of a movement that aggregates, the idea that we can learn the wrong things is therefore a big idea. Now I am thinking, I have in many circumstances invested my time, but I did learn, thought that what I learned was good, but those were all wrong things. And that's really something for us to reflect on, to think about, that the size of the investment in whatever we make kind of adds value, and sets the stage, and influences us to think that what we have learned was good. So in the case of learning the wrong things, we get true outcomes, not only the wrong things, but also the assumption that whatever we learned aren't wrong at all. So we keep on going. That's really tricky, and to some extent, or to a greater extent, sad.

And, of course, what Brian is taking us is indeed a reflective exercise of asking us to be conscious about learning how to learn. Brian and Reed doing a good job there, having identified that under pressure, that's a skill and that's very important. And then he goes on with his advice saying that, open quote, if you go to the right source, end quote, you would not need to keep on digging, such as going after too many other sources. He pointed out an example that when he was tasked to learn about management, he was lucky that he received an advice from an experienced entrepreneur, an investor, who recommended to him the book, open quote, High Output Management, end quote. Open parenthesis, we need a footnote here, close parenthesis. Thus, he didn't have to keep on digging and reading a lot of management books, he says. Of course, this is Brian, he's the CEO of Airbnb. At that point, he had major investment from a renowned Silicon Valley firm and investors such as Reed Hoffman next to him. He was basically saying that you need to access a valuable network as the one he had. So he's certainly recognizing that in the context of you being successful, you may actually have connections to successful networks. But with that said, he also goes back to the point or to essential aspect, which we need to be responsible for this topic of learning how to learn and consciously looking for the right sourcing with the right network that gives you access to such sources. With the students as his audience, he points that books are cheaper version that you can open quote, certainly read about the best, end quote. And that he particularly learned, learns as well from biographies.
