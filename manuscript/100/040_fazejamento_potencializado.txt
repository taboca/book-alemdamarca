## Fazejamento potencializado 

Now, back to the trouble and moving towards more trouble anyway, or before that, we should to celebrate that through the getting things done in a given domain also had given to us a great deal of reasons to that way, following that logic. If we look from our heritage and history, specifically in this domain, this is so because many restaurants, food establishments, used to run by a relatively and virtuous slow cycle. In other words, restaurants had time to learn through real interactions or word of mouth were given and what to do used to follow, to some extent, some of these slow cooking rules.

The place would give what people wanted and these things generally were given by the local distribution systems and networks, regions and customers would give them suggestions and eventually recommend. Then the place would rise serving and to a point where new customers would at certain day out of the sudden find themselves in front of that location and see a sign since 1964, out of the sudden. They were there and that were the model, that were when we ask, that we can find when we ask some of our parents and friends, the elders, they generally say stories, tell us stories about these places, that these places were so good, so many stories that we have time to listen to them. Now thus we are really now positioned in front of the trouble or at least a confrontation. Let us move into that.
