Plates like falafel and the Brazilian acarajé and the lamen and maybe even the Brazilian coxinha are plates that actually have strong identities and yet the best places you know that they carry on the idea that they are not stuck in time so they are progressing they're evolving this experiences so the article where this article is about the opportunity a thought where when we get involved in food and with the experiences and the recipes and the cultures the specific things when you go there and you dig you shouldn't be afraid because you're not gonna be stuck in time so variability doesn't have to come only because of you are saving cost, or trying to capture a market in a hurry, although saving cost can actually take you to be creative but the variability there can come in many different ways and that can help you with the identity of your establishment. 

This may be the case with the world of falafel and acarajé and certainly so many other things; or the actual point here is that this is the case with anything we do in life. But let us consider falafel and acarajé first. 

Certainly certain things from the world of food experiences have called my attention, the falafel. How come every falafel be so different and yet be a falafel? And the same with acarajé, we may say that each acarajé is unique - or at least if you hear that from the protagonist, you will know it’s an acarajé. So then, how come every acarajé be so different and yet be an acarajé; I may even go ahead to think that if the acarajé is not different then it’s not authentic. 

Since I started to think from this angle, I certainly took myself into the need to actually widen the range of food experiences that fits this criteria - unique values arranged so elegantly that it gives us room to progress into advancing these categories. So let’s add to that Ramen too, for now. So these are examples of food experiences that appear as a category, which follows a common denominator. 

One way to look at this is to consider the idea of a solar system, with planets that are very different, indeed, but at the same time they are all in a way aligned, around a sun, all connected in a way. 

When I had included Ramen was during my trip to Salamanca, in Spain. I wasn’t expecting to find so many Ramen places in Salamanca - but finding them around November, with the weather getting cold, had really warmed things up. The very first Ramen was surprisingly good. Then another had a surprise it, I wasn’t expecting beef and mushrooms. At this moment, reporting on my trip experiences, I remembered that my friend who went to Japan recently reported that one of the best Ramens he had - in life - was a vegetarian one he found in Tokyo. So Ramen may comply with the solar system rules, by giving a certain framework and at the same time enabling these creators to advance the whole Ramen experience. That may be a way to see things - they are all advancing the whole story, their planets are different, unique, yet they spin around a certain sun. Now, what would be the core values of the Ramen? Maybe the fact that it has to be served very warm? As a customer, in November in Salamanca, I would certainly expect that. But now, reflecting on that, I remembered that that very same friend had in the past reported that he loved a summer creation in São Paulo city at Kazu Ramen. It was cold Ramen. But let us, for a while, lock in that variable, as a value, to keep things simple, considering that a good Ramen will generally be served quite warm - unless you really know what you are doing - as a key element. I would think that another element is the quality and the texture of the noodle. 

### The DNA of the falafel 

### The DNA of the acarajé 

### Missing values - the case of advancing croissant in Brazil

Now, we should address an actual complex situation which arises when we try to create let us say new worlds but they aren't centered around values. 

This subject is complex because, certainly, innovation depends on change and experimentation, and certainly on the movement where we need to go further to actually see if we have found interesting things. 

With that said, there is always variability that seems to take us away from the possibility of improving the whole experience. 

A case worth considering is the situation with the croissant in Brazil, which I rather not use the word development or evolution, neigther to place them in a category, but anyway it may not be difficult to find these as croissant looking, salty ones, and always stuffed with things before the baking process - the stuffed croissant. Now, it is reasonable to give our folks the benefit of the doubt if where we are going is to hurt ourselves here, in other words we should certainly acknowledge that if we let them play we may find good things later, but for now and to make a point, let us focus on a somehow a category of establishments where stuffing them with a volume of things is a pattern.  

Now, the potential problem here, mainly for the actual business although customers are paying the bill too, and which creates a confusion, may relate to a behavior like a certain addiction where we attempt to add value but in fact the action does work the other way around, as in in the direction that more is less; but of course the problem is that in a hurry we may not actually be able to notice that.  

Now, an origin of problems may be related to the fact that we do take for granted existing categories of experiences - like the croissant - without getting it, without knowing what they are, its values, which take us to produce versions who are poorer, and then, as an attempt to save, we try to add value on top. This is so because if we take for granted, the given, by failing to find its values, we may set ourselves in a direction to propagate further the problem - the misunderstanding to some degree - yet taking advantage of category-item, of its reputation and need by the market, and here is where we engage, in a way in being creative on ways to market it, which is where things can go haywire. 

#### Elaboration of the problem 

By assuming that it sells, perhaps by a reputation, then what follows given that we didn't live through and we didn't identify essential values which characterizes that initial experience, we take ourselves, we enter a path of development which may be considered as when things go haywire. 

As an example, a croissant establishment may bake something that has in a way a shape of a croissant, thus it does pass some of the criteria, but in the end it fails the french test. Then, because the design followed from a bad route, additional work of invention gets in the way as an attempt to fix the puzzle which in fact is this phenomenon is more like a movement of making the whole experience to appear as value to the customer. By following that model, we engage into the idea of “adding” value, by creating variations such as to stuff things inside, especially by stuffing things people generally understand, like sausage, beef, brocoli with cheese, that sort of pathway.  

What they can do can then cost them a lot because once they missed understanding key characterizations of a good croissant, they are simply moving further into that attempt to widen the appeal or to some extent to fix the situation by forcing attributes that are intended as common value, like commodities, in an attempt to gain recognition or acceptability. Moreover, that pathway takes them to potentially feed a heavier production process with the added complexity which does not solve the yet outstanding confusing factors. 

In other words, they would be putting themselves in a situation of managing a heavier operation while not creating value that takes them into a virtuous pathway - where actual variability introduced certainly threatens the whole. 
To be fair - and here is where things can really be confusing to many places - the product and the whole establishment may actually be able to survive. Thus, it is not that an official croissant certification association shuts down their operation. In reality, what they may have created is to some extent a valid arbitrary meal, stuffed. And the problem with that goes back to the very behaviors that give room to that “accelerated” movement. because when we do not care about all of that, we may too do the same sort of approach in other areas. 
And the real cost of maintenance adds with time, plus if the business by doing that starts to damage itself, then again the sort of same “strategic” responses appear like automatic behaviors of our operations leading to a snowball effect. 

### Could coxinha planets around the same sun? 

Now in the realm of Brazilian things, it seems that a coxinha could be expanded by having that coxinhas solar system in the first place. I would say so because the coxinha follows a certain structure and offers space for variability. So, as an example, variability with the ingredients used in the dough, spices within, with the texture that it gains on the surface. 

Now, with that said, we should observe a pattern, or tendency which relates to the complex case of the Brazilian Stuffed Croissant, where our needs to push the boundaries too quickly - likely driven by the pressure to widen the market or to make the whole establishment centered around the coxinha experience - take us to focus on, again, on the stuffings. So here is where certain coxinha places lock certain elements and go ahead and give to the customer a lot of stuffings which they are accustomed to, as if to please various tastes from customers.  

With this model pushed to the limits, we may consider that the coxinha dough becomes a sort of plate where the things in the middle seem to be the actual food they are ordering. So then, when browsing the menu, the customer find herself picking up from things she likes, which comes from the basic stuffings, closer to what a traditional chicken coxinha has, but then it goes all the way to, let us say, whole plates, like strogonoff, or feijoada.
