This idea I call spaceships. I think that it may, perhaps, create some confusion. But I ask you to follow me for this trip. Before we know what the spaceship is about, I have to tell you in advance that this is an idea in progress; with this I am therefore inviting you to consider what follows as notions. So as I go through the aspects of it, and the cases presented, I am therefore presenting to you with that intention, of one that is yet seeking, developing or discovering what this is about, and inviting you to join me. 

Now, the reason I am saying this is because I almost missed noticing it, maybe so because the thing is moving. 

So let us stand there, in front of what would be perhaps the first appearances of these kinds of these alien things, spaces, or establishments, let us see. 

Many years ago, a friend introduced to me a different kind of place, a place to drink beers resembling a pub, in the city of São Paulo, although one quite different for the days. They had special beers, draft, and no food served. Sometimes a partner food truck would park in front of their door. But different from other places they had a particular schedule, as they would generally open on very specific days, like on fridays. For me it was quite surprising to see that sort of arrangement so I asked myself “how come they can do that?” But of course when we see something new that is real, what comes next is that we find an explanation, and this is when I generally find myself saying “of course they can”, or “they have the right to open anytime they want”. And that was the case because the learning was that the owners were colleagues, they were doing something else, and that they wanted to have a place for themselves, what could be called a second home or a second work. One speculative thought, implied at the time, was to think that they had the conditions, as in privilege, so they came up with something for themselves, a special place where they could have the beer they wanted, and them, it happened that the place was also open to the public, for other reasons, but certainly it was a special place that would be interesting for a specific niche given that the user/customer had to accept the specific hours, the style of beer, music, and other characteristics they brought to the place, such as no food.  

But having experienced that in São Paulo city - where everything is possible - would not prompt one to create a special bucket and keep that place in it looking for similar things. Yet the place was kept in my memory, in a special unknown category, up to when I found other places in the city of Ribeirão Preto, more than a decade after. 
Now living in the city of Ribeirão Preto, I found three other places, so now the bucket exists, it helps to collect these cases, and it is, for now, the spaceship bucket. 

One point though, before we proceed: I am not suggesting that a place like these is better than others as we know it. The point here is, as said, to keep the bucket open, to observe and consider how these arrangements can take us to consider new possibilities for everyone involved, the crew. 

Now, from the city of Ribeirão Preto one other spaceship is a larger one in terms of space, and has around 160 square meters. It’s also oriented to beer enjoyment but they brew their beer. In terms of the crew, there are two captains with a variable team of from one to four. One captain is in charge of beer making operations, his nickname is Frango. And the other, _______, which happens to be his wife, is responsible for the product designs, and quality, as she has the rank of a sommelier. They are both involved in taking care of whoever is aboard, like the rest of the crew. By observing the crew we also found that they had a relationship with the captains from a local major university, involved in courses like mathematics, economy and others.

In terms of working hours, they might be seen as a place that is generally closed throughout the week, and when open I think it goes from probably noon to five PM. We went there many times, mainly myself and my other friend who happens to be the same one who introduced that other place in São Paulo a decade before - nicknamed here as Vedigas. So Vedigas might be a good space explorer. 
When we get there and pick a seat we find a menu printed on A5 paper and placed in a vertical display, with a selection of beers, always fresh and subject to change at any time based on the production line. All the beers follow the Belgium style. 

Once we got onboard for the first time, after the discovery investment of Vedigas of course, we were totally surprised, and excited, with thoughts crossing our heads such as “wow how come this place exists here in this city?” and that sort of question. We had certainly experienced something amazing, through the beers and by riding there in that spacious ship along with the small crew. And when you are in that position, like a fan or like an entrepreneur or a new member I don’t know, it comes as a sort of natural movement of protecting the place. 

In that position, I may have engaged in a sort of natural movement of supporting them as if I were a captain, in a way fighting for them. And it was when I was wearing let us say a captain’s hat, suggesting ideas to them, that we were caught, actually, in front of first lessons about who they were, and a bit towards understanding their mission: 
I or we may have suggested something related to advertising, or marketing, expressing our thoughts to the passing captain Frango. And it didn’t take long to get a sense that he had a conviction that the way they were navigating was right, or steady, or that they had a north guiding them. It the place was a all broken up ship with shity beers, we would certain be quiet, not ever talk again with them, and know they were navigating towards a spiral of death or something. But that wasn’t the case, the beers are special, the crew quite confident. So, for now, initially, it sounded like “something is wrong here” but at the same time “something is right” and perhaps other crossing thoughts would happen as in “let us keep our mouths shut so that we can continue to come here and the place continues to be this way”. 

When we hear thoughts from the captains, we sense they know certain things we don’t know, and we sense a confidence level oriented to values. What they say goes along with the experience we have everytime we enter the ship: We feel our connection right when we sit at the table and we get to see the menu right away while a crew member brings cold water in a bottle with cups - which is unusual in Brazil - and popcorn, ask it or not. There is a ritual right there, which takes us to start with a lighter belgium beer. 

The food options aren’t written in the menu in front of us, like the beers, although we can order from other places or bring from home. So the point can’t be missed - you are there to experience their beer creations. So it’s a laboratory in a way, for experiencing beers, which goes well with the style because Belgium style goes well with that kind of mission, a space to be creative. So that brings us to their spaceship name, Experiência. 

Usually, we go there by three in the afternoon, knowing that they close at five. That works well for us because these days we drink less, and better, so it’s a greenlight to go, a visible limit, as we know they would not allow us to extend too much. With that said, when there are not many passengers, we many times had extended our experience with the captain’s approval, perhaps a number of times we left by eight or nine, a bit drunk because usually we end with the stronger beers. 

Now, regarding the food policy, two points should be made. One is that by not having food, we do not run the risk of spoiling the whole experience, such as by ordering junk food from the outside. Point two is that they do have a few options from a menu which is not advertised - besides the automatic popcorn servings; and it turns out that these options are actually great, likely better than many bars in Brazil: Simple, straightforward, well done. One is a cup with long slices of carrots and cucumber resting in a water with lime and salt, the other are chicken nuggets (which actually has chicken meat in it), and they too have a crispy and seasoned fried potato plate that reminded me of the how places from USA love to season the potatoes. 

So it’s nice when you find a place that does not have an official kitchen but at the same time their simple food menu exceeds the expectations and what other bars have. 

So that is a bit from the experience at Experiência, and their journey. For me, yet, it is unclear what exactly is their mission. And who knows if they fully know too. What we know is that we are taken, when we are there. It is always a good trip. 

Now, let us consider another spaceship, one also found by Vedigas the explorer. This one is a place nearby to Experiencia, also framed by the world of beers, although very different. They are quite small, the size of a standard ship container. You enter the ship and you will be in front of the captain, solo style, serving another wine cup to himself. The ship has his name outside - Ebrio. And inside, at the center, one big table which gives a limit to the number of passengers and at the same time setting them to meet thus becoming part of the crew. We are surrounded by a great selection of beers from around the world - beers which are difficult to find in the city - so in part the mission may have to do with experiencing these beers. Small ship, a common table at the center, passengers and captain close to each other, the subjects are heard by everyone, and sometimes a beer cup does a little tour, and that is it. 

Now, not from the world of beers but I had found another ship closer to the place where I live. This is not a big place and it’s written “Coffee with Books” on the outside. I would not normally put this place in that bucket because, really, it’s a normal coffee place. But then through two events I had the clue. The first one came when I caught myself suggesting - why don’t you … - and the captain told me no, that she wanted to keep that way, sort of line. And then another day, I caught a lady from a table also giving her a suggestion, and she did the same. Later, talking with the captain, she explained that she already owns a successful food business, and continued to give clues that that one ship was about a place for her to stay there, to work through the day, or spend the day, around the books, her books.  I would say “a place for her which happens to be open to the public”. 

One point to consider from these stories is that with all of them a pattern seems strong: that they aren’t going to change anything anytime soon, and if they are it would be really difficult to be related to the last thing that a passing passenger said. Along with that, there are suspicions that they are running with enough fuel to keep their trajectory.

So this seems to explain in some cases the hours they operate and other particular characterizations. 
What is interesting, and that gives us a point to a reflection, goes back to what can’t be missed, of them having a good sense of direction: They are immune to arbitrary tips from the customer, or sales representatives. And I would say that they are in a good position of progress in the sense of having a traction that means less work and better chances to understand results, where things are going in terms of the relationship with the passengers, the crew, and the actual mission. 

Perhaps we could consider that they are running in slow motion - outside the pressure of the world which asks them to accelerate by following rules from the external environment tied to the market. 

Being at these beer places along with my explorer-and-friend Vedigas, and having noticed us passengers on their side and wanting those places to keep open, it takes me to consider more about why we value these places. When I look at the beer theme, it is something and it’s certainly a common value, certainly in part inviting us there. And along, there are other elements in it, some of them we even don’t know, such as that the places are calm or the fact that we can have a conversation with their captains. 

But I want to keep this bucket open because more might be going on here. They might give us a place, an unique arrangement, which takes us into rituals in a way. Not exactly like a religious ritual but also not far from that notion. 

In *The Power of Rituals*, Casper Ter Kuile had looked at how different institutions - such as churches or tribes - through history and identified common elements not related to specific worldviews which are there and can be considered as the elements which are meaningful for us to be together. 

These elements are: The means to connect with ourselves, the means to connect with our fellow others, our society; the means to connect with our nature, and the means to engage in what he calls transcending. 

Taking us back in time, he brings clarity on how rituals given by tribes or churches had put us together through events: A small city in the past where no one had the means to connect with others crossing boundaries, had given to local people, through their local church, a place well serving these elements, through events and gatherings, like rituals, not mention the celebrations which always carried good food, as in food made by families, done together or under the supervision of the captains of the monasteries, with quality control and that sort of thing. 

This perspective helps us in the face of changes in our modern world which change in many ways how we interact with the environment. For many, certainly the world is lost, as they see so many overlapping perspectives which can mean confusion, with their religious institutions losing control in certain ways, or others even dismantled as they were. There is certainly a greater variability in our new world, as we had considered throughout this book, given that we are in a position to access, and get involved, with far too many communicative experiences of a networked world - too many views which may not follow from a guiding path.  

With that said, the very elements considered by Casper also give us a view that helps to understand and explain why so many modern dynamics bring us together and to some extent fulfills those functions.  A case presented through the book are the Harry Potter book clubs, which essentially carry on the elements and give to many people much more than a reading experience of a fiction book, a leisure experience. In fact, many who go to Harry Potter reading clubs, value their clubs as essential as others value their religious groups. 

Now, I ask, what are these captains doing once they have set their trajectories that way and invite others to join? I feel that I can find a more precise answer to “what are you doing?” when I go to standard restaurants with answers such as “we are expanding” or “we are serving customers what they want” (and making money along).

But when I think about these spaceships, for now, I rather think that they are onto something else and that this something else brings, to more or less extent, elements that reminds me of the dynamics brought considered In the Power of Rituals. I am not saying that there is a main book, with weekly chapters, taking us to reflect about our lives, to connect with others, to get to know our nature better, and to transcend. I am saying that it may take us to value ourselves, to value our connections, to value our world, and with that may set us to read the next week, to work the next week, to keep on moving the next week, so that we can go back to these spaces and experiences. Or, that some of these spaceships, by holding an identity through a trajectory, are in fact carrying on a theme that projects values where a group of people join around, and then while it’s not a ritual it sort of carries the power of rituals. 
 
### Considerations on the lonely journey that is unrealistic

So, here is a point that we need to remember when we are considering that these spaceships are so particularly within a given journey that they're never going to affect anything anyway, right? Because they seem to be an execution journey that, first of all, is not being paid by the actual market. They might be just doing whatever they want to do because they have the resources and they have, to a certain extent, a safe space, or an investment if you will, to keep on going. And many of them, as we know, although they do have the customers on their side, call them fans or lovers or excited users anyway, they might not be hearing them that much. In some circumstances, they are so involved with a specific niche cause that exactly the point we made before, the point that we made before, is that they're immune to those external advices, they're interested in scaling that. So, all of this situation set us to believe, to think that they are in fact not a problem at all, right? They're just an experiment, they're just a science project, they're never gonna grow, they're never gonna affect the market. But here's something for us, that meanwhile, as they're doing that solitary journey, that could be a problem. Because, see, they have that level of interaction with these fans or users or excited users or customers that love them. And through that virtuous interaction, they're actually learning right there. So, they have the community on their side. So, even if you think that they're not going to grow and scale and affect you, in fact, something may change along the way. Or let's say they need to actually scale because now they need to pay the bills for some reason. Or they can sell that company to another, and even though this company is gonna, let's say, standardize them or normalize them, taking care of the accounting. So, that's gonna imply, perhaps, in some experience, they're poor indeed. But yet now, they do carry some characteristics of that strong brand and strong community, and they are now in the market.

A point here to observe is that as they are executing that journey, they are advancing, they are understanding, they are coming up with data, they are interacting with the external environment, they are to some extent validating all these interactions and that is real data for a potential growth phase of evolution or transformation.

O que temos aqui é um caso de reflexão, um momento para nós. Isso é realmente um novo conhecimento, não é? Por exemplo, vamos considerar como eu conheci o Rodrigo, em português, no edifício, quando eu o movei de uma casa como uma farma para a cidade, para morar em um pequeno edifício. Nesse momento da minha vida, eu também estava passando por uma transição, voltando a um projeto que estava fechado. Eu abri novamente esse novo capítulo na minha vida, decidi focar em completar um livro. Nesse momento, já seria cerca de 6 anos de investimento, apesar de não ser realmente como escritor. Talvez como alguém tentando ser um escritor, escrevendo e não escrevendo, e desistindo, voltando a isso de novo e de novo. Mas nesse momento, eu fiz a decisão, porque, através dos pulos, navegando pelo mundo dos escritores e, eventualmente, melhorando, em um certo momento, eu fui convidado para uma escola com um publicão, e essa escola envolvia escrever três artigos por semana. Para mim, foi bastante desafiante. E eu disse à pessoa que me convidou para esperar um pouco, porque eu tinha que pensar, porque se eu decidir fazer isso, então eu vou ter que fazer isso corretamente. E então eu passei pelo material de leitura e as requerências, e eu encontrei outras desafios, como criar textos que fossem mais orientados aos temas que eles tinham, a certos temas, para que não fossem apenas escrituras arbitrárias. E então, outras requerências, em termos de compreensão com certas estruturas de escritura. Em frente a esse desafio, eu estava certo de que eu aprenderia muito. Mas também, com esse tamanho de comitimento, eu estava certo de que seria um investimento, e esse foi o momento em que eu percebi que eu tinha esse livro escrito por Ralph Ray, que precisava desse tipo de investimento. Então eu disse não, eu decidi voltar para a minha escrita, exatamente quando eu me movei. Eventualmente, eu contei ao Rodrigo, que trabalha na entrada do prédio, sobre isso, e, com o tempo, eu descobri que, diferente de mim, ele era um avido leitor. E, eventualmente, eu aprendi que ele levou mais de 200 livros, principalmente livros de ficção, e onde nossas palavras se cruzaram exatamente, em termos da possibilidade de, em algum lugar em nossas vidas, nós sermos leitores. Ele veio de um ângulo diferente. Eu vim de um ângulo mais técnico, não disposto a escrever ficção em geral, certo sobre meus materiais não-ficcionais, mas eu estava, nesse momento, passando por esse investimento. Tendo decidido escrever ou trabalhar como leitor, nós tivemos muitas conversas, porque, de qualquer forma, eu não sabia o que fazer. Nós tivemos muitas conversas, porque, todos os dias, em frente ao prédio, quando eu estava esperando para a minha transportação, nós sempre falávamos, eu sempre exposto o desafio, nós sempre falávamos sobre alguns desafios de ser um leitor, e ele começou a me dar, também, suas insights baseadas em materiais que ele também assistia, observava, refletia sobre o desafio de ser um leitor. Com o tempo, eu lhe disse sobre páginas de manhã, sobre como a obra de Jules e Cameron me ajudavam, e ele, eventualmente, começou a fazer as páginas de manhã, que ele afirmou que mudaram sua vida também. Com o tempo, ele, eventualmente, decidiu começar a considerar a primeira fase de organizar as ideias para seu próprio livro.

So, we had right there, by chance perhaps, or from the point of view of Julie Cameron, perhaps synchronicity, but right there we were, we had identified a world that is very far from the world where we are in. We have seen that it's, we had hopes that we could live in that world, but we also know that we were back on Earth. So right there, it's an example that I realized that through these conversations, we kind of created a ritual right there, because that ritual would be the protection giving us hope that we could get there. So he supported my path as a writer, which of course can be seen by this book material, which is the third book in my list, and I supported his path towards being a writer. We are not talking here about a specific spaceship, that it's a physical place that we go. We're talking about a space, nevertheless, of conversations where we can expose our challenges, where we can better understand where we're going, where we can actually find structured ways and supports to get there. Nevertheless, that's in a way, that relates to this concept of the spaceship. And by the way, right now, when reflecting about this, and recounting this case, this story, I see Rodrigo's architectural design for his spaceship, because he said once, and we even interacted or iterated slightly that idea of his Sebo, bookstore, that it's a hybrid between a cafe and a Sebo, and I would think that his Sebo is that kind of spaceship, giving him a journey towards that place, a place that he can actually exercise, protect certain values right there. And that's it.

And back to the metaphor of the spaceship going through an exploration, what they are creating essentially, it's exactly because the future world is sometimes distant of the Earth's reality, we're basically creating the space-time conditions so we can exercise that journey. In terms of the interstellar travel, that would be kind of like the concept of the wormhole. It's a place, say, that you go and you get there and you are to be warped and you appear in other side of the universe. So we don't want as users or customers or explorers, we don't want that wormhole to be closed at all. We want to preserve. That's why we get together into these spaceships, into that mission, as explorers nevertheless. Preserving the condition, the space that gives you the opportunity to exercise some values, to access values that you are interested in. Now, this is not a metaphor, although presented as a metaphor, as a story, it's not at all disconnected from how we in reality evolve and take ourselves by the day, through life, how we advance. Earth for us, if you consider the network of space, can be seen as the very network that can access everything. But here is a problem. It is earth because it sounds like down to earth. And also because although the network can take you anywhere, we're mostly, to a certain extent, trapped by the very network, by the narratives that we are involved, by the work, by the family, by the buildings where we live, by the routine, and that of course involves our habits. So the connections that we have usually are the same, and the same connections are talking about the same things. I'm not just talking about people, but I'm talking about all the connections with channels as well. Think about the feeds or the channels that you access online. Think about your infinite wall, although it's infinite in your content apps, it is also infinitely giving you the same kind of things that you once visited. The same jokes, the same kind of dances, the same kind of marketing-oriented messages, you name it. So that's earth where you could access or pass through different new things, but it's to a certain extent is impossible. So this is like a wall around us, and value emerges in terms of changes for us when we can pass through and access different networks. According to Ronald Burt, this is the idea of the structured holes, structured roles. And Professor Burt claims that because the number of connections that you can have is not infinite, you need to manage your connections, your communications, and access different networks with the new values that are important to you, with different values that can aggregate your life. So this would be like, instead of having many contacts in your university, you keep less contacts with the key representatives of your space, and then you save some of your connections to these outer spaces, also, if possible, to key contacts over there. That's essentially, in a way, like that metaphor of the wormhole.
