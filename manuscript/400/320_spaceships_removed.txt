* [ , anchored] @todo - p1 - In "Spaceships ..." - Reflect on the dual considerations for "spaceships": (A) as a manifestation of the "scratch and itch" effect, and (B) as the birthplace where community values are exercised in a colleagueship context. Review Reid Hoffman's point from his interview with Brian Chesky, which emphasizes how being guided by the community provides essential guidelines. Incorporate this perspective into the framing of spaceships, highlighting the role of community strength and guidance. @refid-20241210-4cf621a1-6f56-4475-939a-3d660760e8c5

Relatório de um passageiro em missão - sobre o dia que tomaram o controle da nave. 

> *Saturday, around 3PM in Earth’s Gregorian calendar datetime system. Not different from other days, we knew and were okay knowing of our formal window, which was short, from 3 to 5pm which was the ship’s official closing time. Although we started with three, this time our team was five. A little problem was that one of our experienced colleagues came in late, by 4PM. He wasn’t worried much, initially, because he knew - based on prior experiences, that the crew would give us a bit more time.* 
>
> *Although we all hoped for some extension, we too knew of their rules: Strict closing when the captains had formal events to go, or other situations like when one of the captains had a soccer game to watch. In these circumstances they had to kick us out around 5PM. But we may have sensed more pressure as it was around the end of the year, where there are more end of year parties approaching. Andry didn’t take much time to acknowledge his plan: No worries, I will catch up with you guys. I wanted to help him with advice so I told him to jump to the stronger beer that we were drinking - as in Belgium stage three. But he preferred to advance by complying with the ritual, starting with a light beer and moving through stages. He apparently didn’t see a problem in accelerating and assured he would arrive at the stronger beer with us. I noticed too that he was ordering larger glasses while we were on smaller cups.*
> 
> *Anyway, with the 5pm check point approaching, we asked one of the crew members if they would allow us another round? With that, a couple rounds had passed. From this point in time, we might have noticed a movement of crew members in the next room, on the other wing area. They were organizing a table and it seemed like a celebration. It didn’t take long for us to figure it was their end of the year official party, which explained why so many crew members were there that day. Then one of them approached us and asked us, crisp and clear, if we wanted to take control of the control room - explaining that it required us to know how to control the multiple beer faucets, and do the accounting of orders ourselves.*
>
> *By the time I heard one or two voices saying yes, most of us were already walking towards the control room for what turned out to be a quick training session. We learned the basics with how to dispense the beer. As for the accounting system, we didn’t trust ourselves with the computer (although most of us had formal training in Computer Science) and preferred to do the accounting on paper.*
>
> *From that point on, time for us had passed differently. Around 9PM in Earth’s time, we interrupted one of the captains from their party and asked help with the process for releasing us. We closed our table, wished each other a good year and left.* 
>
> *From this other journey, we can certainly confirm that trust is developed from values being exercised. What I might add now, on the other hand, is that the journey is never static, that with these spaces our journeys always take us to discover new things. And although we do learn a few things about the science going on, I would say that the best is really that we are essentially discovering more about ourselves, bringing back values that we might have missed back on earth. What we have is an opportunity to develop trust, bounds, it’s a place where we have space, where we can breathe, a place to talk, to think, to be ourselves, and a space which let us be humans.* (Marcian X)



### 


Now, I ask, what are these captains doing once they have set their trajectories that way and invite others to join? I feel that I can find a more precise answer to “what are you doing?” when I go to standard restaurants with answers such as “we are expanding” or “we are serving customers what they want” (and making money along).

But when I think about these spaceships, for now, I rather think that they are onto something else and that this something else brings, to more or less extent, elements that reminds me of the dynamics brought considered In the Power of Rituals. I am not saying that there is a main book, with weekly chapters, taking us to reflect about our lives, to connect with others, to get to know our nature better, and to transcend. I am saying that it may take us to value ourselves, to value our connections, to value our world, and with that may set us to read the next week, to work the next week, to keep on moving the next week, so that we can go back to these spaces and experiences. Or, that some of these spaceships, by holding an identity through a trajectory, are in fact carrying on a theme that projects values where a group of people join around, and then while it’s not a ritual it sort of carries the power of rituals. 
 
### Considerations on the lonely journey that is unrealistic

So, here is a point that we need to remember when we are considering that these spaceships are so particularly within a given journey that they're never going to affect anything anyway, right? Because they seem to be an execution journey that, first of all, is not being paid by the actual market. They might be just doing whatever they want to do because they have the resources and they have, to a certain extent, a safe space, or an investment if you will, to keep on going. And many of them, as we know, although they do have the customers on their side, call them fans or lovers or excited users anyway, they might not be hearing them that much. In some circumstances, they are so involved with a specific niche cause that exactly the point we made before, the point that we made before, is that they're immune to those external advices, they're interested in scaling that. So, all of this situation set us to believe, to think that they are in fact not a problem at all, right? They're just an experiment, they're just a science project, they're never gonna grow, they're never gonna affect the market. But here's something for us, that meanwhile, as they're doing that solitary journey, that could be a problem. Because, see, they have that level of interaction with these fans or users or excited users or customers that love them. And through that virtuous interaction, they're actually learning right there. So, they have the community on their side. So, even if you think that they're not going to grow and scale and affect you, in fact, something may change along the way. Or let's say they need to actually scale because now they need to pay the bills for some reason. Or they can sell that company to another, and even though this company is gonna, let's say, standardize them or normalize them, taking care of the accounting. So, that's gonna imply, perhaps, in some experience, they're poor indeed. But yet now, they do carry some characteristics of that strong brand and strong community, and they are now in the market.

A point here to observe is that as they are executing that journey, they are advancing, they are understanding, they are coming up with data, they are interacting with the external environment, they are to some extent validating all these interactions and that is real data for a potential growth phase of evolution or transformation.




### Accessing the wormhole

O que temos aqui é uma oportunidade para reflexão sobre como o ambiente - que traz relacionamentos, ferramentas, e espaços - está bem no caminho dos nossos sonhos. Eram meados de 2023 quando me mudei de um local tipo fazendinha para a cidade, para um pequeno apartamento no centro de Ribeirão Preto. Nesse momento da minha vida um novo capítulo estava se abrindo - uma jornada entre o aspirante escritor para o mundo do trabalhador escritor. 

Neste momento meu envolvimento com a escrita era complexo, ou longe do que seria o trabalho do escritor. Eu carregava um projeto de livro desde 2018, sobre empreendedorismo. Este era um projeto complexo onde eu alternava entre momentos de escrita, momentos de pesquisa e grandes períodos de pausa. Eu sempre voltava, eventualmente, mas sempre também encontrava grandes frustações com o processo. Essa dinâmica dificultava entender que eu poderia estar diante de uma jornada em construção. Em paralelo, eu escrevia esporadicamente para uma publicação online, sobre gestão e empreendedorismo com um toque de psicologia. 

Eu estava rodeando, talvez sonhando acordado mas de qualquer forma tentando me aproximar desse mundo. Também é importante mencionar que nessa época eu já havia esbarrado na autora Julia Cameron, no livro *O Caminho do Artista*. No universo paralelo de um astronauta explorador solitário, eu estava preparando a nave para uma jornada. Nesta época também acabei comprando outro livro da Julia, intitulado *The Right to Write*. Agora é fácil encontrar no diário de bordo os agradecimentos deixados para a Julia, quase todos os dias nas páginas matinais, por conta dos pensamentos iluminados que trouxeram clareza e suporte para continuar essa jornada de transição do sonhador-escritor para o trabalhador-escritor.

O ponto de partida, no entanto, aconteceu depois que recebi um convite para um programa de *fellowship* com a publicação que eu já estava escrevendo. Caso aceitasse a missão de três meses, minha meta envolveria escrever entre um a dois artigos por semana. Eles estavam me oferecendo um ambiente que trazia objetivos claros, resultados esperados claros e mensuráveis, além de suporte no sentido de mentoria e interações com outros editores. Mas apesar de construtivo e produtivo, era bem desafiador pois escrever um ou dois artigos por semana me tiraria da zona de conforto. E pedi para a pessoa que me convidou esperar um pouco para eu pensar. 

E foi durante este momento, no cockpit de uma nave, refletindo sobre a jornada, que tomei uma decisão que até hoje vejo como inusitava. Eu decidi voltar para aquele meu projeto de escrita. Enviei uma mensagem formal, agradecendo mas declinando a oferta, e posicionei que o estaria investindo em um projeto de um livro meu. 

Foi assim que decolei, seguindo um rumo e com uma visão mais clara que deveria investir - como quem faz um ou dois artigos por semana. Se por um lado não entrei em uma outra nave espacial mais profissional, com mentores e editores e um processo, por outro estava tentando organizar um processo na minha própria nave. Foi neste momento, já naquele apartamento no centro de Ribeirão, que esbarrei no Rodrigo que trabalhava na portaria. Durante as passagens pela portaria, lançando me para a jornada, e na medida que fui revelando que estava escrevendo um livro, fui desconbrindo que tínhamos certos objetivos comuns.  

Eu descobri que, diferente de mim, ele era um avido leitor. Eventualmente aprendi que ele leu mais de 200 livros, principalmente livros de ficção, grandes obras. Ele veio de um ângulo diferente, de viagens como leitor pelos mundos da ficção. Eu eu de algumas viagens como estudante e empreendedor do mundo da não ficção. Mas também eramos iguáis no sentido de exploradores que consideravam os meios sobre como acessar aquele mundo distante - o mundo dos escritores. 

Tendo decidido escrever, ou trabalhar como escritor, fomos trocando conversas, porque, de qualquer forma, eu não sabia exatamente o que fazer. Nós tivemos várias conversas, na frente do prédio ou quando ele fazia folga, via Whatsapp. Muitas das nossas conversas eram sobre os desafios de ser tornar um escritor. Eu disse para ele sobre a Julia Cameron e outros insights que me levaram a decisão enquanto ele também trazia insights e pensamentos que me ajudavam com o processo, a partir de muito daquilo que ele também já havia coletado, observado, refletido, coisas sobre os desafios do caminho. Com o tempo, eu lhe disse que estava envolvido no processo da Julia das páginas matinais. Ele eventualmente começou a fazer as páginas todos os dias de manhã e não demorou muito para também confirmar que aquele processo estava também mudando a sua vida. Provavelmente celebramos em algum ponto que as páginas poderiam também levar ele para querer escrever, por exemplo de tarde, coisas que poderiam se tornar um material de escrita. Com o tempo, ele comunicou sua intenção sobre um dos seus livros. Celebramos muitas vezes o que a Julia Cameron nos deu. 

So, we had right there, by chance perhaps, or from the point of view of Julia Cameron, perhaps synchronicity, but right there we were, we had identified a world that is very far from the world where we are in. We have seen that it's, we had hopes that we could live in that world, but we also know that we were back on Earth. So right there, it's an example that I realized that through these conversations, we kind of created a ritual right there, because that ritual would be the protection giving us hope that we could get there. So he supported my path as a writer, which of course can be seen by this book material, which is the third book in my list, and I supported his path towards being a writer. We are not talking here about a specific spaceship, that it's a physical place that we go. We're talking about a space, nevertheless, of conversations where we can expose our challenges, where we can better understand where we're going, where we can actually find structured ways and supports to get there. Nevertheless, that's in a way, that relates to this concept of the spaceship. And by the way, right now, when reflecting about this, and recounting this case, this story, I see Rodrigo's architectural design for his spaceship, because he said once, and we even interacted or iterated slightly that idea of his Sebo, bookstore, that it's a hybrid between a cafe and a Sebo, and I would think that his Sebo is that kind of spaceship, giving him a journey towards that place, a place that he can actually exercise, protect certain values right there. And that's it.

And back to the metaphor of the spaceship going through an exploration, what they are creating essentially, it's exactly because the future world is sometimes distant of the Earth's reality, we're basically creating the space-time conditions so we can exercise that journey. In terms of the interstellar travel, that would be kind of like the concept of the wormhole. It's a place, say, that you go and you get there and you are to be warped and you appear in other side of the universe. So we don't want as users or customers or explorers, we don't want that wormhole to be closed at all. We want to preserve. That's why we get together into these spaceships, into that mission, as explorers nevertheless. 

Preserving the condition, the space that gives you the opportunity to exercise some values, to access values that you are interested in. Now, this is not a metaphor, although presented as a metaphor, as a story, it's not at all disconnected from how we in reality evolve and take ourselves by the day, through life, how we advance. 

Earth for us, if you consider the network of space, can be seen as the very networked environment which we can access everything. But here is follows a solution and a problem. It is like eath, our environment, and although it gives us an network - which says that it can take us anywhere, we're mostly, to a certain extent, trapped by our very relationships in this graph, by the narratives that we are involved, by the work, by the family, by the buildings where we live, by the routine, and so on. 

So the connections that we have usually are the same, and the same connections are talking about the same things. I'm not just talking about people, but I'm talking about all the connections with channels as well. Think about the feeds or the channels that you access online. Think about your infinite wall, although it appears to be infinite, and with that that it could connect you with infinite worlds, reality is that it infinitely gives us the same kind of things that are accessing, or that we have visited. The same jokes, the same kind of dances, the same kind of marketing-oriented messages, you name it. So that's an earth where we could access, ideally, different new things, but it's to a certain extent it is the same earth that gives us walls around us, walls of information. 

The way to break through these walls involves to be conscious about our relationships with our connectios and how we form and maintain relationships through networks. This is where Ronald Burt helps us, through his work entitled *Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition*, with an organized perspective on how we can look at our networks and find opportunities. A key point from Burt helps us to understand that we can't have inifinite connections with all networks around us; with that that we need to manage our connections wisely, such as our communications consciously. Burt's explanation points how the very connections around us in fact does set a challenge towards accessing different networks and find opportunities. This is so because we develop strong ties within our known networks - by establishing valuable relationships with those around us such as family, a school or work team, friends and more. By increasing our relationships within our known networks, we end up establishing redudant relationships which do not translate in value added to us plus takes our attention too preventing access the outer world, and its opportunities. Once we are aware that we have too many relationship which are redudant with existing networks, we can then consider reducing the relationships by focusing on the most valuable channels (special contacts, knowledgeable points of contact, best resources) which opens up the possibility for using our attention to reach out to new connections of distant networks. And by following the same rule, as we get into these distant networks, we may as well focus on the key relationships. 

Now, even when we manage to open up our time and intention to find value in new networks, yet a challenge to do so has to do where to go from where we are so that we get to where we want to be? This is also another key aspect from Burt's research, which calls our attention to the opportunities around two networks, and two ways to look at it. One is to consider the notion reffered as weak ties - whereas these are links between different networks, like people who happens to be in your network and also to act like bridges towards other network domains. The notion of weak ties isn't new in Burt's work, but important when we consider the gap between networks. Now, what it new from Burt's research is the notion of the structured holes which involves considering the absense of a connection between networks, and with that the opportunity. This way of looking at the picture gives us an opportunity to consider how to navigate from a network to another domain - either by finding the weak ties or by actualling becoming the one who fills the gap. Now, this theoretical perspective on the ways one can access a new domain of opportunities in a way also may help us to see in perspective that when we act towards an opportunity, by seeking new contacts which think alike (the ones with the similar aspirations or living the same pains) or by engaging with interaction spaces of many kinds like courses or communities with causes - or spaceships through my storytelling  - can be considered a movement of us involved in figuring out the hole, how to pass through. And althought it may not look like we are interested in becoming ourselves the bridge - as in to get involved helping the exchange from both ends, we do live through and gain values of being the explorers who had brought ourselves from world A to world B.  Essentially, back to the spaceship cockpit, we are trying to create a safe way to continue the journey, along with others, networking our way up.
