Now, of course, the initial question there would be to consider that we just need to eat and then continue to do our stuff, right? So, what pretty much we have in front of us is that occasionally we need to eat. Now, with that said, the eating kind of goes along with the actual next step for us, and that's why in the theory of the jobs to be done, the milkshake case comes in handy because we are, to a certain extent, parallelizing and walking along with the food experience. Maybe part of this situation is because we are not anymore giving ourselves the time we need to eat, we cannot go back home, and so on. And then it turns out that through the eating ritual, we actually do so many other things, but that didn't start today. If you think about the wedding parties, they have food, and then there is many of the concept of the happy hours for companies, and we have the birthday parties with cakes, and et cetera, and we have many kinds of celebrations. And then festivals, they usually have food as well. So, the food is everywhere, and they are next to it, or kind of, in a way, giving a framework there, either because we need, and we do that through food, or because we're doing a certain job, we need to get the food along the way. And that brings us to interesting whole experiences, like the hamburger moment with the family. And some people could judge that it's not certainly the healthier option there, right? But then, even people there, that they do a routine, a healthier program, routine, a healthier program, they have a healthier calendar, let's say, routine. Families, they kind of give allowance for a certain day, the burger experience with the family, and that's kind of like the moment where they allow, you know, the junkie moment, and that kind of thing. But they do pick, there's variability there. Some of them do pick even healthier burgers, non-healthier burgers, and that's a moment where they allow to drink soda, that sort of thing. So, I'm pointing here that the burger moment can be actually a kind of a party in a way. Maybe because, exactly, that resembles the exaggeration of the big parties. So, that's something to consider here. Not for the introduction, certainly. This should go within the first chapter, when I contextualize how food experiences are present in our lives.

But then this time was pretty new to me because I was not expecting the delivery boy from the motorcycle to tell me that he gave me five stars. And in the circumstances of my apartment, actually, normally they deliver at the entrance, and that's it, that's just about delivery of the food. And I am the person that gives them stars. But this day, I was hungry, and I ended up going downstairs and waiting there. And then he told me that he gave me five stars because I did a good job, something like that. And the tone were of a pressure, I felt, but I couldn't understand because it was totally new for me.

* [ ] @todo - p1 - In "Spaceships" or "Estante da culinária" - Check the e-mail entitled "project / book / além da marca / capítulo estabelecimento zen" which talks about the possibility that an establishment is a value-genration enviroment not only for customers but also for the crew. Marcio talks about all places, spaces, to become a space of opportunity for people to interact, to be calm, to be friends; and how that model has a lot to offer. To somme extent, perhaps, this model is what many companies don't want - like to be too much oriented to therapeutic function - but on the other hand, many companies also in the end of the day are working likely because of the growth function that is associated with some therapeutic aspects. [ ] Check too that Brian Chesky may have communicated in the recent days that he does not like 101 because these meetings end up being therapy meetings. This may be a good article to check - because it comes from  Brian. @refid-20250115-27167de8-328d-49e7-bc58-986e33a24a38

* [ , ] @todo - p2 - In "A estante da culinária" -  #Future #bookintroductions - Consider to also incorporate the ideas from the introduction of the book "La Cocina Sagrada" which finds the sweet spot among religions.  @note Check - One point from the book, open quote, La Cotina Sagrada, end quote, by Deborah Chomsky, in its introduction, it says, recognize that society is changing with its cultures, religions, different beliefs, literally, mosaic, human and social. And she recognized the need to learn from the plural society. She uses the term Torre de Babel, the Babel Tower, which culture through cultures and gastronomy. She wonders, open quote, Nos cerramos a tal diversidad o aprendemos de los otros y nos enriquecemos con estas nuevas perspectivas, end quote, of course in Spanish. She says that the purpose is the plural plural cooking, or open quote in Spanish, Cotina Plural es la propuesta final de este libro, como para ayudarnos a entender el futuro como cada vez más complejo y global, period, end quote. She makes a point that she is going to cover, to the reader, to discover aspects related to food and spirituality through five different religious cultures, more traditional ones, Hinduism, Judaism, Christianism, Islamism, Buddhism. She claims that through that perspective, we will be able to understand the meaning of the festivities they have and the food and the value from each culture. @refid-20241210-4b9b2000-ce87-48be-a7ae-fa8725566440
