## Thanks

* VE - @contact:VE, Vanessa Erika, life partner, advisor, supporter. Vanessa had provided a great deal of support through the time since the early days with ideas that seemed - and actually were - all disconnected up to the point when things started to connect; in other words through years and through uncertainty before certainty. She had too provided reviews to many writings from I asked her, impacting the movement towards the world, towards taking me to advance in the face of criticism, and growing as an author and as a professional. 

* CG - @contact: CG, Christian Guimarães, friend, advisor - helped with experiences and conversations a lot related or experiences lived together to some extent. Had pointed Fabiano Caxito, pointed Clecios, and articles. 

* JC - @contact: JC, Juliana Cobre, friend, advisor, and editor - She provided a review to the Justificativa text, first, and then she had helped with what Marcio calls "translation", as she gets what Marcio is saying and takes in consideration the potential misinterpretations of the reader. This level of sensibility, for an editor, can be major. 

* GE - @contact: GE, Glória Edini Galli, my mother who has a great interest in communication from a languages perspective. She had given reviews from time to time, supporting the construction of the formal text, the justification letter which was sent to major publications in Brazil, which was accepted within the phase of initial prospection of a major publication in Brazil. 

* RS - @Contact:RS, Rodrigo Silva, writing colleague who became a friend during the writer days. I am thankful to Rodrigo for being a supporter of process of transformation of a writer. We exchanged ideas about the difficults and strategies to become a writer, for one year. His thoughts, observations, ideas were applicable to many topics ranging from the challenges to be a writer to actual content and the challenges to make content meaningful and interesting to people.

* OM - @contact:OM, Omar Morad, who I met at the cafeteria Pagliaroni in Ribeirão Preto. I am thankful for our conversations and for having met Omar who is a combination of an entrepreneur in the food establishment world with a historian. Ref 220_cliente_chato_e_fiel

* XX - @contact:XX, _____, a writer from Ribeirão Preto who I met during the local book fair ni Ribeirão Preto. When I brought the theme of food establishments, he told me a great story, which fit within an article and where I was able to crack the code of the "Brazilian Feijoada"; should be brought to this book, as a case of a thought that matches the notion from Airbnb founders - the holistic design.
