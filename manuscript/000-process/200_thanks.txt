## Thanks

* VE - Vanessa Erika  - Support, all - Provided review to the Justificativa sent to major publications. 

* JC - Juliana Cobre - She provided a review to the Justificativa text, first, and then she had helped with what Marcio calls "translation", as she gets what Marcio is saying and takes in consideration the potential misinterpretations of the reader. This level of sensibility, for an editor, can be major. 

* GE - Glória Edini Galli - Had provided review to the formal text, Justificativa, sent to major publications. 

* RS - Rodrigo Silva - General, writing. 

* OM - Omar Morad - (Check his last name)  - Ref 220_cliente_chato_e_fiel 

* SL - Silvia Leite, empreendedora, Torta Holandesa - Ref 100_torta_holandesa.txt)

* XX - XXXX XXXX - A writer from Ribeirão Preto has given to Marcio a great story, when we had a coffee session during the "Feira do Livro" event in Ribeirão Preto at Café Pagliaroni. His narrative about the "Brazilian Feijoada" should be brought to this book, as a case of a thought that matches the notion from Airbnb founders - the holistic design. Ref 210_holistic_design.txt
