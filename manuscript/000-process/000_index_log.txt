## Todo 

* [ ] Check the insight commnet - when the youngsters control technology ...like leading evangelists and docs and UI, and you don't know what goes on, like clichês, they follow. 

* [ ] Get the summary, short, which was sent as the introduction message in the letter to Senac, which can be found in the reply e-mail from Senac. That as one of the shortest explanations, seem amazing. 

* [ ] Expand the content in 110_visceral_different.txt

* [ ] Check e-mail entitled "Book - além da marca - noticing the communication" Whicih could be helpful to the first part of the book where it offers a way to think about how we "get going" with life or how we fall out of a parashoot situation. This section offers a context to an essay that touches in ideas from Walter Fisher (Narrative Paradigm), Peter Drucker, and others. 

* [ ] Check e-mail and audio - "queijo and uber" 

* [ ] Check email entitled "Livro - Além da Marca - Caso da feijoada autor", [ ] Check e-mail entitled "Livro - além da marca - feijoada", which has an audio too. 

* [ ] Check if the article "220_cliente_chato_e_fiel.txt" has the right things which Marcio wanted to be in. Check against the note left by Marcio entitled "Livro - além da marca - caso do quantitativo cantina Romar". 

* [ ] Check the e-mail entitled "Projeto / além da marca / capítulo - riqueza do sistema maquina capitalista" which talks about the cheese that was bought by Christian; at the same time the experience with the Mozanna. 

* [ ] Check the e-mail entitled "Livro - projeto - além da marca - depois que estado de excelência é conquistado" which talks about the apparent situation of stagnation but, on the other hand, considers how the existance of the place does a social function, for example to new customers; but its existance, its functional operation. This note also makes a reference to a letter which may have been sent to Pagliaroni where Marcio talked about families at Pagliarone, about babies crying and the cartoon book which was given to the kid. 

* [ ] Check the e-mail entitled "Livro - além da marca - cultura e tradição o lado bom" which may offer insights about the special things from the things special from the past, and how we may actually misunderstand things, and how we may sometimes fall into the situation of missing the point about the past. 

* [ ] Check the e-mail entitled "project / book / além da marca / capítulo estabelecimento zen" which talks about the possibility that an establishment is a value-genration enviroment not only for customers but also for the crew. Marcio talks about all places, spaces, to become a space of opportunity for people to interact, to be calm, to be friends; and how that model has a lot to offer. To somme extent, perhaps, this model is what many companies don't want - like to be too much oriented to therapeutic function - but on the other hand, many companies also in the end of the day are working likely because of the growth function that is associated with some therapeutic aspects. [ ] Check too that Brian Chesky may have communicated in the recent days that he does not like 101 because these meetings end up being therapy meetings. This may be a good article to check - because it comes from  Brian. 

* [ ] Check the e-mail entitled "Livro - além da marca - sinopse apresentação primeiro parágrafo". [ ] Check the e-mail entitled "Projeto livro - além da marca - prefácio ou introdução - experiência saudável" which may have a line of writing that can be helpful, could perhaps replace other writing. 

* [ ] Check the e-mail entitled "Livro - além da marca - fazer não fazer reclamar fazer acontecer e necessidade de expressão" which almost brings up a point "chicken and the egg problem" but somehow I could not yet figure the motivational point. It may be about giving collaborators the opportunity to express some of their pains, about creating some possible channels. 

* [ ] Check the e-mail entitled "Livro - além da marca - tecnologias painéis" which refer to the experience acquired with the Tela Social project, and the idea that screens, and communication "through hallways" could actually be used in virtuous ways to help the development of the team.
