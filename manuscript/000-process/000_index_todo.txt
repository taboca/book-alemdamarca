* [ ] @todo - p1 - In #progress #buildtolast #core "Values and progressing" - Edit this chapter to consider the case of Brazilian mayonese, or "Batatonese" and the the Spanish contribution to this domain. As I spent 30 days in Spain, having found many places with that "mayo salad" which they called "Russian salad" or "Ensaladita" I end up redefining my views. In other words, Spain helped me to rethink possibilities for this thing which I thought was pretty much too basic to accept changes. So here is a reflection about when we anchor ourselves around one way of doing, static, it's when we lose the opportunity. 

* [ ] @todo - p1 - In #progress #buildtolast #core "Values and progressing", after we arrive at concept from Build to Last, consider the insight from Dorothea Brande's about how it feels, an apparent trick? Where the progress with "purposeful action" feels fast, and her point that purposeful action is stronger. (Ref 160_progressing_with_no_core)

* [ ] @todo - p1 - In #progress #buildtolast #core - Bring the case of Jim Collins into the subject, the case of entrepreneurs. Ref /  as we consider this idea we should incorporate here the ideas from Jim Collins and Jerry Porras, through the book Build to Last, where they present the concept of "preserve the core, and stimulate progress". (Ref 160_progressing_with_no_core)





* [ ] @todo - p1 - #JTDB #categories #rise - "So, when I talk about the jobs to be done through the introduction, I guess, or maybe not, actually within part one, talking about the world and the need for us to actually create these spaces or experience that gives us the opportunity to advance with the actual other higher order jobs that we need to be done, I have actually referred to the jobs to be done theory, and then we have these spaces, these experiences, these eating experiences in the middle. Now, of course, the initial question there would be to consider that we just need to eat and then continue to do our stuff, right? So, what pretty much we have in front of us is that occasionally we need to eat. Now, with that said, the eating kind of goes along with the actual next step for us, and that's why in the theory of the jobs to be done, the milkshake case comes in handy because we are, to a certain extent, parallelizing and walking along with the food experience. Maybe part of this situation is because we are not anymore giving ourselves the time we need to eat, we cannot go back home, and so on. And then it turns out that through the eating ritual, we actually do so many other things, but that didn't start today. If you think about the wedding parties, they have food, and then there is many of the concept of the happy hours for companies, and we have the birthday parties with cakes, and et cetera, and we have many kinds of celebrations. And then festivals, they usually have food as well. So, the food is everywhere, and they are next to it, or kind of, in a way, giving a framework there, either because we need, and we do that through food, or because we're doing a certain job, we need to get the food along the way. And that brings us to interesting whole experiences, like the hamburger moment with the family. And some people could judge that it's not certainly the healthier option there, right? But then, even people there, that they do a routine, a healthier program, routine, a healthier program, they have a healthier calendar, let's say, routine. Families, they kind of give allowance for a certain day, the burger experience with the family, and that's kind of like the moment where they allow, you know, the junkie moment, and that kind of thing. But they do pick, there's variability there. Some of them do pick even healthier burgers, non-healthier burgers, and that's a moment where they allow to drink soda, that sort of thing. So, I'm pointing here that the burger moment can be actually a kind of a party in a way. Maybe because, exactly, that resembles the exaggeration of the big parties. So, that's something to consider here. Not for the introduction, certainly. This should go within the first chapter, when I contextualize how food experiences are present in our lives.

* [ ] @todo - p1 - In #spaceships, need to check the data from Experience, Frango’s wife. 

* [ ] @todo - p1 - In 030_fazejamento_estabelecimentos, we are making a reference, likely to the idea of jobs to be done which were presented earlier; we need to make sure that such link helps with what comes next. 
* [ ] @todo - p1 - In 030_fazejamento_estabelecimentos, there are a number of references to the word "ritual". This seems to make sense, but, we need to understand why "ritual" needs to happen; in other words, what comes next. 


* [ ] @todo - p1  - In 040_fazejamento_potencializado, bring back Maslow 

* [ ] @todo p1 - Consider, in 040_fazejamento_potencializado, the citation from Joseph Schumpeter, about getting things done and entrepreneurship, and the point of saturation of trying to innovate in the world of abundance.

* [ ] Book - ADM - Book - livro - adm - tecnologia trabalho e linguagem, incorporate into book - Saturday, November 23⋅6:45 – 7:45pm - https://docs.google.com/document/d/11tM9McRL6zSA9Jf3OLY1WvPtZpU8LxXYBARfHYf8fSA/edit?usp=drivesdk - Incorporagted into part 1  - https://docs.google.com/document/d/11tM9McRL6zSA9Jf3OLY1WvPtZpU8LxXYBARfHYf8fSA/edit?tab=t.0

* [ ] Book - ADM - introduction - review points - Deslocamento - to the reader, to be out of that situation which we all know what it is, when we are taken. And this is so, detachment set us together because this material was brought because of detachment, as I had experience, years and years working from these places, not being there as I will explain. 

* [ ] Case of cold egg São Carlos - Uma vez em São Carlos, olhei para a janelinha de onde saiam as comidas de uma das lojas de uma conhecida franquia de fast food e lá tinha uma folha A4 pregada com umas 5 sentenças para lembrar os colaboradores da relação  entre o ovo e o cliente: O cliente não aceita o ovo frio, nunca servir um ovo frio, o lanche deve ser feito com o ovo quente, e outras 2 que diziam a mesma coisa.  

* [ ] Check the insight commnet - when the youngsters control technology ...like leading evangelists and docs and UI, and you don't know what goes on, like clichês, they follow. 

* [ ] Get the summary, short, which was sent as the introduction message in the letter to Senac, which can be found in the reply e-mail from Senac. That as one of the shortest explanations, seem amazing. 

* [ ] Expand the content in 110_visceral_different.txt

* [ ] Check e-mail entitled "Book - além da marca - noticing the communication" Whicih could be helpful to the first part of the book where it offers a way to think about how we "get going" with life or how we fall out of a parashoot situation. This section offers a context to an essay that touches in ideas from Walter Fisher (Narrative Paradigm), Peter Drucker, and others. 

* [ ] Check e-mail and audio - "queijo and uber" 

* [ ] Check email entitled "Livro - Além da Marca - Caso da feijoada autor", [ ] Check e-mail entitled "Livro - além da marca - feijoada", which has an audio too. 

* [ ] Check if the article "220_cliente_chato_e_fiel.txt" has the right things which Marcio wanted to be in. Check against the note left by Marcio entitled "Livro - além da marca - caso do quantitativo cantina Romar". 

* [ ] Check the e-mail entitled "Projeto / além da marca / capítulo - riqueza do sistema maquina capitalista" which talks about the cheese that was bought by Christian; at the same time the experience with the Mozanna. 

* [ ] Check the e-mail entitled "Livro - projeto - além da marca - depois que estado de excelência é conquistado" which talks about the apparent situation of stagnation but, on the other hand, considers how the existance of the place does a social function, for example to new customers; but its existance, its functional operation. This note also makes a reference to a letter which may have been sent to Pagliaroni where Marcio talked about families at Pagliarone, about babies crying and the cartoon book which was given to the kid. 

* [ ] Check the e-mail entitled "Livro - além da marca - cultura e tradição o lado bom" which may offer insights about the special things from the things special from the past, and how we may actually misunderstand things, and how we may sometimes fall into the situation of missing the point about the past. 

* [ ] Check the e-mail entitled "project / book / além da marca / capítulo estabelecimento zen" which talks about the possibility that an establishment is a value-genration enviroment not only for customers but also for the crew. Marcio talks about all places, spaces, to become a space of opportunity for people to interact, to be calm, to be friends; and how that model has a lot to offer. To somme extent, perhaps, this model is what many companies don't want - like to be too much oriented to therapeutic function - but on the other hand, many companies also in the end of the day are working likely because of the growth function that is associated with some therapeutic aspects. [ ] Check too that Brian Chesky may have communicated in the recent days that he does not like 101 because these meetings end up being therapy meetings. This may be a good article to check - because it comes from  Brian. 

* [ ] Check the e-mail entitled "Livro - além da marca - sinopse apresentação primeiro parágrafo". [ ] Check the e-mail entitled "Projeto livro - além da marca - prefácio ou introdução - experiência saudável" which may have a line of writing that can be helpful, could perhaps replace other writing. 

* [ ] Check the e-mail entitled "Livro - além da marca - fazer não fazer reclamar fazer acontecer e necessidade de expressão" which almost brings up a point "chicken and the egg problem" but somehow I could not yet figure the motivational point. It may be about giving collaborators the opportunity to express some of their pains, about creating some possible channels. 

* [ ] Check the e-mail entitled "Livro - além da marca - tecnologias painéis" which refer to the experience acquired with the Tela Social project, and the idea that screens, and communication "through hallways" could actually be used in virtuous ways to help the development of the team.
